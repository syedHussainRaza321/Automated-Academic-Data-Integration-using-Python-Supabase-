Saravanan1, S. Neelakandan2*, P. Ezhumalai3 and Sudhanshu Maurya4\\nAbstract\\nCloud Computing, the efficiency of task scheduling is proportional to the effectiveness of users. The improved sched-\\nuling efficiency algorithm (also known as the improved Wild Horse Optimization, or IWHO) is proposed to address\\nthe problems of lengthy scheduling time, high-cost consumption, and high virtual machine load in cloud computing\\ntask scheduling. First, a cloud computing task scheduling and distribution model is built, with time, cost, and virtual\\nmachines as the primary factors. Second, a feasible plan for each whale individual corresponding to cloud computing\\ntask scheduling is to find the best whale individual, which is the best feasible plan; to better find the optimal indi-\\nvidual, we use the inertial weight strategy for the Improved whale optimization algorithm to improve the local search\\nability and effectively prevent the algorithm from reaching premature convergence. To deliver services and access to\\nshared resources, Cloud Computing (CC) employs a cloud service provider (CSP). In a CC context, task scheduling has\\na significant impact on resource utilization and overall system performance. It is a Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP)-\\nhard problem that is solved using metaheuristic optimization techniques to improve the effectiveness of job schedul-\\ning in a CC environment. This incentive is used in this study to provide the Improved Wild Horse Optimization with\\nLevy Flight Algorithm for Task Scheduling in cloud computing (IWHOLF-TSC) approach, which is an improved wild\\nhorse optimization with levy flight algorithm for cloud task scheduling. Task scheduling can be addressed in the cloud', 'created_at': '2025-10-12T09:06:17.484+00:00'}] count=None\n",

Published by ETH Zurich, Chair of Software Engineering ©JOT, 2009\\nVol. 8, No. 1, January-February 2009\\nCloud Computing: Today and Tomorrow\\nWon Kim, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, S. Korea\\nAbstract\\nDuring the past few years, cloud computing has become a key IT buzzword. Although\\nthe definition of cloud computing is still “cloudy”, the trade press and bloggers label\\nmany vendors as cloud computing vendors, and report on their services and issues.\\nCloud computing is in its infancy in terms of market adoption. However, it is a key IT\\nmegatrend that will take root. This article reviews its definition and status, adoption\\nissues, and provides a glimpse of its future and discusses technical issues that are\\nexpected to be addressed.\\n1 STATUS\\nPerhaps the simplest working definition of cloud computing is “being able to access files,\\ndata, programs and 3rd party services from a Web browser via the Internet that are hosted\\nby a 3rd party provider”[Hodson08] and “paying only for the computing resources and\\nservices used”.\\nOften cloud computing is used synonymously, inaccurately in my view, with such\\nterms as utility computing (or on-demand computing), software as a service (SaaS), and\\ngrid computing. Of these, as I will show below, utility computing and SaaS are merely\\ntwo of several forms of service cloud computing can provide. Grid computing is simply\\none type of underlying technologies for implementing cloud computing.\\nThe term “cloud” in cloud computing is used synomously with “data center”. Today\\nthe computing field is able to envision transitioning into the cloud computing era because\\nof the breath-taking advances in computing and information technologies during the past\\nthree decades. The advances include the buildup of the Internet backbone, the widespread\\nadoption of broadband access to the Internet, the powerful network of servers and storage\\nin data centers, the advances in high performance and scalable sof', 'created_at': '2025-10-12T09:06:20.924589+00:00'}] count=None\n",
